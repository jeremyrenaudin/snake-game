# Snake Game
Let's develop the famous Snake Game using object-oriented programming in Python.

## Rules
The goal is to control the snake using arrow keys to eat food represented by blue circles. Eating food makes the snake's tail grow. But pay attention, the head of the snake cannot collide the walls or the snake's tail!

## How did I break this project down?
I broke down the problem of building the snake game into 9 steps.

1. Create a snake body
2. Set the snake in movement
3. Control the snake
4. Detect collision with food
5. Create a scoreboard
6. Detect collision with a wall
7. Detect collision with the tail
8. Track and save high score
9. Ask user to play again

## Files
- `main.py`: application that runs the game.
- `snake.py`: package to model the snake.
- `food.py`: package to model the food.
- `scoreboard.py`: package to initialize a scoreboard.
- `data.txt`: text file to store the highest score.

## Keys to play
Simply play using Up, Down, Left and Right arrow keys.
